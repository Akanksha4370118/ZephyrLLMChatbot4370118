An example chatbot using [Gradio](https://gradio.app), [`huggingface_hub`](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/v0.22.2/en/index), and the [Hugging Face Inference API](https://huggingface.co/docs/api-inference/index).
This project creates a personal gym trainer assistant using Gradio for the user interface and the Hugging Face Inference API for generating responses. The assistant helps users with relaxation exercises, advises avoiding negative thoughts, and guides them through steps to manage stress. It can also provide tips on weight loss and intermittent fasting.
